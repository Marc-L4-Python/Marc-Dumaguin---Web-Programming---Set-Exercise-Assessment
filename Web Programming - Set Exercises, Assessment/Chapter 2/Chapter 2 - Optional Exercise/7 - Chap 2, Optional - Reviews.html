                    "An exhilarating slalom through the wormholes of Christopher Nolan's vast imagination that is at once 
                    a science-geek fever dream and a formidable consideration of what makes us human."

                    "This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation 
                    about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that."

                    "Brainy and exciting at the same time, Interstellar invalidates the need for mindless Hollywood product. 
                    No matter its shortcomings, the movie achieves an impressive balancing act. It turns the mysteries of the universe 
                    into a cinematic playground, but for every profound or visually arresting moment, it also encourages you to to think."

                    with a soul wrapped up in all the science."
