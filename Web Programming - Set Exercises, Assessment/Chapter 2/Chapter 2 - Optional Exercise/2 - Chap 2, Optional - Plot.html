                    &nbsp;&ensp;&ensp;When the ecosystem collapses in 2067, worldwide hunger poses a threat to human survival. During a dust storm, farmer and 
                    former NASA astronaut Joseph Cooper finds a gravitational anomaly with his daughter Murph. 
                    This takes them to a covert NASA facility, where they discover there is an ongoing mission to use a wormhole close to 
                    Saturn to find a habitable planet. Cooper reluctantly leaves his family behind and joins a team of scientists to pilot 
                    the Endurance spacecraft, which includes Dr. Brand and his daughter Amelia. <br><br>
                
                    &nbsp;&ensp;&ensp;Upon exiting the wormhole, the crew encounters several challenges, among them being time dilation. 
                    On the first planet, they lose a member and watch as 23 years go by in a matter of hours. Murph, who is growing up on Earth 
                    during all of this, is trying to solve the equation that will allow humans to leave.

                    &nbsp;&ensp;&ensp;On the second planet, they meet Dr. Mann, who deceives them and jeopardizes their mission. Romilly dies, and the Endurance 
                    sustains damage. After Cooper and Amelia make a risky detour around the black hole, another 51 years go by. <br><br>

                    &nbsp;&ensp;&ensp;Cooper becomes trapped in a four-dimensional tesseract and uses time travel to communicate with Murph in order to give 
                    her crucial information. When he returns, humanity has flourished on a new colony. On the third planet, Cooper and TARS meet up 
                    with Amelia and start over, leaving Earth and its memories behind.
